"""
In Python, a keyword is a reserved word that has a special meaning and purpose within the language. Keywords cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names or function names) because they are reserved for specific syntax or functionality within Python itself.

Python's standard library provides a set of keywords that are part of the language's syntax and cannot be redefined or used for any other purpose. These keywords serve various purposes, including defining control flow structures (like if, else, for, while), defining data structures (like class, def), and managing program flow (like break, continue, return).

s1 : open terminal/cmd and type python and hit enter
s2 : write >>> help() and hit enter
s3 : write help> keywords

Here is a list of the Python keywords.  Enter any keyword to get more help.

False               class               from                or

False: Boolean value representing false.
None: Represents absence of a value or a null value.
True: Boolean value representing true.
and: Logical operator performing logical AND operation.
as: Used in context managers or aliasing imports.
assert: Used for debugging purposes to assert the truth of an expression.
async: Declares a function as a coroutine, used with await for asynchronous operations.
await: Pauses execution of asynchronous function until awaited coroutine is done.
break: Used to exit from loop.
class: Declares a class.
continue: Skips the rest of the current loop iteration and continues to the next iteration.
def: Defines a function.
del: Deletes a reference to an object.
elif: Short for "else if", used in conditional statements.
else: Executes when the conditional expression of an if statement evaluates to false.
except: Catches exceptions in a try-except block.
finally: Executed as part of a try-except block, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.
for: Used for looping over iterable objects.
from: Used in import statements to import specific attributes or submodules.
global: Declares a global variable.
if: Executes a block of code based on a condition.
import: Imports modules or specific attributes from modules.
in: Checks for membership in an iterable object.
is: Compares object identity.
lambda: Defines an anonymous function.
nonlocal: Declares a variable as nonlocal, allowing modification of a variable in a parent scope.
not: Logical operator performing logical NOT operation.
or: Logical operator performing logical OR operation.
pass: Placeholder statement, does nothing.
raise: Raises an exception.
return: Exits a function and optionally returns a value.
try: Starts a try-except block for error handling.
while: Executes a block of code while a condition is true.
with: Used for resource management using context managers.
yield: Returns a value from a generator function.
