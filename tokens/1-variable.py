"""
In Python, a variable is a named reference to a value that is stored in the computer's memory. Variables are used to store data that can be manipulated and accessed throughout the program's execution.  Unlike some other programming languages, Python is dynamically typed, which means that variables can hold values of any data type and the data type of a variable can change over time.

Variables in Python are created by assigning a value to a name using the assignment operator "=".

syntax:
var_name = value
